This is the GGS software collection.


After "cvs co GGS" do 

  bin/apply-links

This generates all necessary links


After changing links you should run

  bin/gen-links

This generates file bin/apply-links
(don't forget to check in this file then)

To compile you need to set GCCHOME to the home directory of gcc
(e.g. /usr/local/gcc) in your shell.

Then issue 

  make dir

(only once)

followed by

  make all
