                        GGS 2003 Tournament results
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The idea of a GGS Grand Prix was thought of in January 2004. For fun, I have
scored the tournaments of 2003 according to the Formula 1 scoring system. Now
since each person who entered a program for a tournament in 2003 did so to
win that particular tournament, not a series. So please don't take the
results below too seriously. Hopefully for the 2004 GP (do `f romano') people
will be more consistent when entering programs. I.e. to choose the same
program(s) for each tournament to be able to accumulate as much points as
possible.

Points distributed as follows:
1st:    10 points
2nd:     8 points
3rd:     6 points
4th:     5 points
5th:     4 points
6th:     3 points
7th:     2 points
8th:     1 point
(Formula 1 scoring system)

                              The tournaments
