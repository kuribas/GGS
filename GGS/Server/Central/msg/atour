|UPDATE: only "dan" and me showed up for the tournament.           |
|        Sad. I thought Amazons would be more popular.             |
|        Maybe next time ...                                       |
|        We played three games of which I won two.                 |

We invite Amazons players to take part in "The First GGS Random

tournament is open for all: humans, machines, cyborgs, clusters, mixed
teams, aliens, etc.

Format:  10x10 Amazons
         No Start Money - No Prizes, Perhaps Fame ;-)
         Thinking Time: 12 Minutes/Player/Game
         Random Starting Positions
         Komi Bidding
         Tie-breaks: "t /td rules tiebreak"
         9 Rounds Round Robin or Swiss System

         Break       12:00 - 13:00 EST
         Second part 13:00 - 15:30 EST
    
         Players need to show up 10 minutes early so that I have
         enough time for registration and tournament setup (/td).

Players new to GGS should make themselves familiar with the system and
the applet (GGSA) way ahead of time. Feel free to contact me in case
of technical problems. My GGS user-id is "mic". The links below
provide useful information.
