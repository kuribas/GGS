Ghost player concept
--------------------

Only /services support ghost players concept.

A ghost player is a player that has disconnected, but is participating
in one or more tournaments. Tournaments have strict time conditions,
therefore, breaking the game and waiting for the player to appear is
not an option (note: this also reduces cheating). Hence, /services
will create a ghost version of a player for the purposes of tournament
matches.

Ghost players are indicated on game /services with "x" instead of "+"
(open) or "-" (closed). For all purposes other than participating in
tournament matches, ghost player is not there.

Ghost will be replaced with the real player once player reconnects.
All tournament matches that are going on (and the player is
participating in them) will send match continuation messages (board,
moves, etc.).

Only registered players can participate in tournaments.

Tournament directors have in their power to start tournament matches
with or without players present!
