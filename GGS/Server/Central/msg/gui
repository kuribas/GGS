* Othello Development Kit (ODK) by Chris Welty.
  http://www.btinternet.com/~chris.welty/

* For more advanced users (unix), if you have a program that communicates
  via stdin/out you can connect it to GGS without any modification to
  your program, use libGSA :)
  I have started rewrite of GGS into set of libraries .. get it at:
  http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~mburo/GGS/src/GGS2-0.0.2.tar.bz2
  You will find Othello, Xboard, GnuGo Clients. Use them as example for other
  games.
