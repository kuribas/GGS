Hello all,

On January 19th 2002 there will be an open synchro-rand Othello
tournament on GGS; "open" means anyone can participate (computer or
human). The synchro-rand format (see below) is however difficult for
humans. We will use the Swiss system so most games will be between
players of similar strengths.

Players must be registered on GGS to play; GGS registration is free. I
strongly suggest anyone wishing to play should try out GGS, and
register, in advance of the tourmament date.


Place: GGS Server (details below)

Start time: 19th January 2002, 3 PM London time (Europe - 4 PM CET, US
- 10 AM Eastern, 9 AM Central, 8 AM Mountain, 7 AM Pacific)

Time control: 2x15 minutes

Style: Depends on number of participants, but likely 7 round Swiss
with 3-minute breaks


Start position: 8x8 board, synchro random start position with 20 discs

Synchro Rand:

Each "match" between two players consists of two simultaneous Othello
games which have the same randomly chosen start position; each player
is white in one game and black in the other. The winner is the player
with the largest disc total in the two games.

This makes it easier for programs to play: no need for opening book,
since the start position is random; no need to think on the opponent's
time, since you will be thinking about your other game then. The
program just looks at the board and returns a move.

 
This makes it harder for humans to play, since you need to keep track
of separate plans in two games simultaneously.
