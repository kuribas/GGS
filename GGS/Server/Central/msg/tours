I talked before about arranging GGS tournaments... however, I've been
having quite a bit of computer and internet trouble lately, but it should
hopefully all be sorted now, so here is my suggested schedule:

---

* Saturday 7:th December, 2002, 15:00 GMT
8x8 Synchro-rand, 7 rounds, 2x15 minutes

* Saturday 18:th January, 2003, 15:00 GMT
8x8 Synchro (but not rand), 7 rounds, 2x15 minutes

* Preliminary date Saturday 1:st March, 2003, 15:00 GMT
10x10, 5 rounds (or more, up to 7, if the turnout is large), 2x25 minutes
The date for this one is only a preliminary one, until I know my studying
schedule for spring.

All of them open to both humans and computers.

If any of those dates are particularly bad, I welcome suggestions for
alternative ones.

Could you pass information about this on to the tournament mailing list,
and any other interested parties?

Thanks in advance!
