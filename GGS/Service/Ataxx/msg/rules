Ataxx rules
===========

Ataxx is played by two players using two-colored discs on an n x n
board. A move consists of either cloning a disc or jumping. Cloning
creates a new disc in maximum-norm distance 1 from a disc which is
already on the board. A disc can also jump to a location in
maximum-norm distance 2.

After cloning or jumping opponent's disc adjacent to the target
location are flipped.

The game ends when neither player has a move, a position has been
repeated three times, or 50 reversible moves (jumps) have been played
in a row. In all cases the score of the game is the current disc
differential. If a player has no legal move he must pass.

Random starting positions are generated by blocking a number of
randomly chosen squares.
