Ataxx game types
================

Syntax:
-------

<board> :: 4,5,...,14
<gtype> :: [S]<board>[K][R<integer>][B|W]
<rtype> :: <board>[R]

<move>  :: <coord-coord>[/<eval>[/<time>]] // e.g: a1-a2/0/10.3

(lower case letters OK)


Semantics:
----------

4(1)14: 4x4 ... 14x14 boards

S     : Synchro mode: two games are played simultaneously. The match 
        result is the average result of both games.

K     : Komi game. Both players have to send the expected game result
        (in view of the player to move) together with the first move.
        The komi value is then calculated as the average of both values
        in view of black and colors are assigned accordingly. If both
        parties report the same value, colors are chosen randomly.
        Black wins if Black's score is > komi, the game is
        a draw if Black's score is = komi, otherwise White
        wins.

        Example:

           Suppose White is to move in the initial position
           Player 1 reports +4 (for White!)
           Player 2 reports +2 (again for White!).
           komi = - (+4+2)/2 = -3
           Player 1 is assigned White, since he thinks White is better.
           Player 2 plays Black.
           White wins if his disc advantage is more than 3.

Rn    : Random game. The game begins with a random starting position
        with n blocked squares.

B|W   : Color preference of the asking player. Only meaningful in non-komi,
        non-random games.

If no K,R,B,W qualifier is given colors are assigned randomly and komi
is set to 0.

Examples:

7      :  Standard 7x7 Ataxx game. Random colors. komi = 0.
S8R18  :  start two simultaneous 8x8 games with 18 random blocked squares.
10B    :  10x10 Ataxx game. The requesting player wants to play black.
9KR20  :  9x9-komi-random-20 game. A random position with 20 blocked squares
          is drawn and the players are asked for their result estimate.
          One game is played.
