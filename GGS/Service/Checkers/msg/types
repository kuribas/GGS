Checkers game types
===================

Syntax:

<type>  :: <board>[K][R][B|W]
<board> :: 6|8|10

Semantics:

6 8 10: 6x6 8x8 10x10 boards
K:      Komi game. Both players have to send the expected game result
        (in view of the player to move) together with the first move.
        The komi value is then calculated as the average of both values
        in view of black and colors are assigned accordingly. If both
        parties report the same value, colors are chosen randomly.
        Black wins if his score is > komi, the game is a draw if 
        score = komi, otherwise White wins.

        Example:

           Suppose White is to move in the initial position
           Player 1 reports +4 (for White!)
           Player 2 reports +3 (again for White!).
           komi = - (+4+3)/2 = -3.5
           Player 1 is assigned White, since he thinks White is better.
           Player 2 plays Black.
           White wins if his advantage is more than 3.5.

R:   Random game. The game begins with a random starting position Unless it
     is also a komi game, two games areplayed simultaneously (*). The match
     result is the averageresult of both games.

B|W: Color preference of the asking player. Only meaningful in non-komi,
     non-random games.

If no K,R,B,W qualifier is given colors are assigned randomly and komi
is set to 0.

(*) not implemented yet.


Examples:

8      :  8x8 checkersgame. Random colors. komi = 0.
