Dots-And-Boxes types
====================

Syntax:
-------

<board>      :: 3..13
<gametype>   :: [S]<board>[K][R<integer>][B|W]
<ratingtype> :: <board>[R]

<move>   :: <coord>[/<eval>[/<time>]] // e.g: A2/0/10.3

example:

  AB CD E                    AB CD E
1 +  +  +                  1 +--+  +
2 |  |     () moves B1 ->  2 |()|    
3 +--+  +	           3 +--+  +

(lower case letters OK)



Semantics:
----------

S     : Synchro mode: two games are played simultaneously. The match
        result is the average result of both games.

3(1)13: 3x3 ... 13x13 grids

K     : Komi game. Both players have to send the expected game result
        (in view of the player to move) together with the first move.
        Sent values can be fractional.        
        The komi value is then calculated as the average of both values
        in view of black and colors are assigned accordingly. If both
        parties report the same value, colors are chosen randomly.
        Black wins if Black's score is > komi, the game is
        a draw if Black's score is = komi, otherwise White
        wins.

        Example:

           Suppose White is to move in the initial position
           Player 1 reports +4 (for White!)
           Player 2 reports +3 (again for White!).
           komi = - (+4+3)/2 = -3.5
           Player 1 is assigned White, since he thinks White is better.
           Player 2 plays Black.
           White wins if his score greater than 3.5.

R<n>  : Random game. The game begins with a random starting position which
        is generated by making n random moves beginning with an empty grid.

B|W   : Color preference of the asking player. Only meaningful in non-komi,
        non-random games.

If no K,R,B,W qualifiers are given, colors are assigned randomly and the komi
is set to 0.
