You can play on boards from 3x3 to 26x26 (even 3x26). Board is always
oriented (normalized) so that height <= width.

It implements:
 - Ko       rule = no repetition of last position, and 
 - Super-Ko rule = no repetition of any  position.
Currently Super-Ko is switched on.

It implements:
 - Japanese scoring = territory + prisoners, and
 - Chinese  scoring = territory + stones.
Currently Japanese scoring is switched on.

Due to so many board shapes and sizes:
 - The komi system is left to players, e.g. tell /gs ask 19x19K <opp>,
 and send the first move with the komi (for 19x19 this is 5.5 .. etc).

 - The handicap system has not been implemented, yet.

Rating system takes score into account - larger win will result in
more points. Resign leads to maximal loss (size of the board), so do
not do it :)

Game starts in PLAY mode. After two consecutive passes (pa) game
switches into MARK mode. In the MARK mode, you mark dead groups.
Marked groups are shown in lower-case. You can unmark the group by
marking it again. Only groups marked by both players are actually
removed. After two consecutive passes (pa) game ends and is
scored. Territory is shown in lower-case letters.
