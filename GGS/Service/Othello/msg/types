Othello game types
==================

Syntax:

<type>  :: <board>[K][R<integer>][A][B|W]
<board> :: 4|6|8|10|12|14|88

Semantics:

4(2)14: 4x4 ... 14x14 boards
88    : 10x10 octogon board (88 squares)
K     : Komi game. Both players have to send the expected game result
        (in view of the player to move) together with the first move.
        The komi value is then calculated as the average of both values
        in view of black and colors are assigned accordingly. If both
        parties report the same value, colors are chosen randomly.
        Black wins if #black discs - #white discs > komi, the game is
        a draw if #black discs - #white discs = komi, otherwise White
        wins. [In anti games (see below) #white discs - #black discs is
        compared with the komi value].

        Example:

           Suppose White is to move in the initial position
           Player 1 reports +4 (for White!)
           Player 2 reports +3 (again for White!).
           komi = - (+4+3)/2 = -3.5
           Player 1 is assigned White, since he thinks White is better.
           Player 2 plays Black.
           White wins if his disc advantage is more than 3.5.

Rn    : Random game. The game begins with a random starting position
        with n>=4 discs. Unless it is also a komi game, two games are
        played simultaneously (*). The match result is the average
        result of both games.
A     : Anti game. Now the player with less discs wins! The scores to be
        sent in komi games are still in view of the player to move. Positive
        values are interpreted as good for the player. E.g. +4 means the
        player thinks he will end up with 4 discs *less* than the opponent.
B|W   : Color preference of the asking player. Only meaningful in non-komi,
        non-random games.

If no K,R,B,W qualifier is given colors are assigned randomly and komi
is set to 0.

(*) not implemented yet.


Examples:

8      :  8x8 Othello game. Random colors. komi = 0.
10B    :  10x10 Othello game. The requesting player wants to play black.
6A     :  6x6 anti Othello game. Random colors. komi = 0. Fun!
88KR20 :  10x10-octogon-komi-random-20 game. A 20 disc random position
          is drawn and the players are asked for their result estimate.
          One game is played.
12R10  :  12x12-random-10 match consisting of two simultaneous 12x12 games
          starting with the same 10 disc random position.
14KR54A:  Silly :)
