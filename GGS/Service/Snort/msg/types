Amazons game types
==================

Syntax:

<type>  :: <board>[K][R][B|W]
<board> :: 4|6|8|10|12|14

Semantics:

4(2)14: 4x4 ... 14x14 boards
K     : Komi game. Both players have to send the expected game result
        (in view of the player to move) together with the first move.
        The komi value is then calculated as the average of both values
        in view of black and colors are assigned accordingly. If both
        parties report the same value, colors are chosen randomly.
        Black wins if #blackmovess - #whitemovess > komi, the game is
        a draw if #blackmovess - #whitemovess = komi, otherwise White
        wins. [In anti games (see below) #whitemovess - #blackmoves is
        compared with the komi value].

        Example:

           Suppose White is to move in the initial position
           Player 1 reports +4 (for White!)
           Player 2 reports +3 (again for White!).
           komi = - (+4+3)/2 = -3.5
           Player 1 is assigned White, since he thinks White is better.
           Player 2 plays Black.
           White wins if his move advantage is more than 3.5.

R     : Random game. The game begins with a random starting position
        Unless it is also a komi game, two games are
        played simultaneously (*). The match result is the average
        result of both games.
B|W   : Color preference of the asking player. Only meaningful in non-komi,
        non-random games.

If no K,R,B,W qualifier is given colors are assigned randomly and komi
is set to 0.

(*) not implemented yet.


Examples:

10     :  10x10 Amazons game. Random colors. komi = 0.
8B     :  8x8 Amazons game. The requesting player wants to play black.
14KR   :  14x14-komi-random game. A random starting position is
          is drawn and the players are asked for their result estimate.
          One game is played.
12R    :  12x12-random match consisting of two simultaneous 12x12 games
          starting with the same random position.
