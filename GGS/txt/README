To compile GGS (GSA):

cd <path>/GSA
cd config
-- edit opts.*, define.h, etc.
cd ..
make dir
make all

If compiler complains that find() method is private in String.*
make it public ..

add
  setenv GSAHOME <path>/GGS
into your .[t]cshrc

Create initial databases for Server/Central, Service/*:

cd Server/Central; main -db_init
cd Service/Othello; main -db_init
...

This creates X.db in db/ subdir of each Server/Service
Log files are in log/ subdir of each Server/Service.

run central server (execute bin/Srv.sh or): 

cd Server/Central 
make run    # will clean old logs
main [5000] &

Test connection:

telnet localhost 5000
root  # login
root  # password
who   # and you should see yourself

add Othello (or all services with bin/Svc.sh):

cd Service/Othello
make run              # clean old logs
main [localhost 5000] &

typing "who" should show /os too.

Service(s) can not function properly unless they are in "_service"
group. First, you should register the service:

name /os Othello Service
email /os <your email>

then, you can add them to "_service" group by entering:

group _service + /os

finally, disconnect service and start it again!
